Building Question Answering Datasets

Here I construct a dataset for training a question answering model. In general, this process is highly manual, requiring the collection of data and, as one might expect, manually constructing pairs of questions and answers that can be found in the text. In our exercise, I provide the data plus question and answer pairs, and work through how to construct the dataset from that starting point.
